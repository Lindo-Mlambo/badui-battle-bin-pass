# BadUI Battles Binary Password Input

BadUI Battles inspired binary password input.\
You can view and interact with the UI here: [Binary Password Input](https://lindo-mlambo.github.io/badui-battle-bin-pass/)

### Challenges:

- styling the checkboxes is nearly impossible. I found out I would have to create a custom checkbox, I was lazy to do it so I stuck with the default checkboxes.
- It shouldn't be difficult but, I want to delay the `form.reset()` to show the checkbox getting checked in green confirming binary input. Otherwise, everything happens so quickly, you never see that green checkbox getting checked and unchecked again ü•≤. - I can simply use the setTimeout function ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
